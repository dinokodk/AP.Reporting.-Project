# AP.Reporting.-Project
A practical simulation of an Accounts Payable (AP) process built entirely in Excel. The project replicates real-world Procure-to-Pay (P2P) workflows — from vendor invoices to payments — and includes an automated AP Aging Report and KPI Dashboard for monitoring overdue balances.
